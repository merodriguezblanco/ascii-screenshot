# ASCII Screenshot

The main idea of this this page is to take advantage of the [navigator.getUserMedia](http://www.w3.org/TR/mediacapture-streams/)
provided by [WebRTC](http://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/) to take a photo and create an ASCII image
representation of it.

You just have to take a photo of yourself using your computer's camera and see the result being
displayed on a grayscale and color ASCII representation.
